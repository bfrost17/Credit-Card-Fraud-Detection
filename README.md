# Fraud Detection Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **fraud detection model** using machine learning algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions effectively. The goal was to improve the modelâ€™s precision and accuracy while reducing false positives and false negatives.

## Key Features
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implemented both **Random Forest** and **Decision Tree** classifiers to detect fraudulent transactions.
- **Data Resampling**: Used **under-sampling** techniques on the dataset to handle class imbalance and improve the precision of the model.
- **Performance Metrics**: 
  - Reduced **false positives** from 37 to 4.
  - Reduced **false negatives** from 7 to 1.
  - Improved the precision of fraudulent record detection from **0.94 to 0.99**.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Programming language used for model development.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Results
The model achieved high accuracy and significantly reduced errors, ensuring more precise identification of fraudulent transactions.
